                          <p>Hi guys ve got the 02 package and have really slow internet. 
                              A speed check online saidi canget 3mbps butit seems more. 
                              like 0.5 these days, just freezing and taking ages to open 
                              pages and open audio files forexample. I have decided to 
                              switch to the UPC package which offers 10mbps but do you 
                              think i will get it?
                          </p>

                          <p>I have internet for 9 month and nevere could benefit from the 
                               full capalcity of 5Mbit/s as it is filtered by O2 when it 
                               detect traffic on public p2p sharing in my situation all my
                               internet speed slows to 512Kbit/s. I never had400KB/s on 
                               downloading from p2p public servers like torrent emule etc. 
                               I downoad with 500KB/s fromprivate thakers instead. So conlcusion 
                               O2 block trafic on p2p connections. Ihave made hundreds of test 
                               in Italyand Sweden and Romania with the same file to doanload 
                               with the samle setting and same antivirus and justneeded to open 
                               ports in firewall and forward same ports and the speed was at full 
                               capacity in 1 minute. here in9 month never had this luck.

                                down the internet as much or do you mean a freebie doenst

                            <p>I pay forthe 4Mb/sec down, 512 Kb/sec up service from O2, and 
                                haven't had any problems. In fact, it's rela-tively quick, and 
                                stable. lt's not perfect, but I really don't have issues, as 
                                long as I keep track of what I'm doingon it. I max out at about 
                                3 Mb/sec down, and 350 Kb/sec up. Probably because of a noisy 
                                telephone line, notbecause I'm being throttied. When my uploads 
                                go over 25 KB/sec (note, bytes, not bits), my download speedsuffers. 
                                This is expected, as downloads require upload bandwidth as well,
